## Resume Format Considerations

I am from Colombia, but I'm currently living in the US, where resumes in word/pdf format are recommended to exclude information. eg. Age, Photo, Relationship. 

I'm going to use the Resume that I have used previously. I try to keep this Resume updated and have worked on it with a few experts on the matter. 

### Converting to HTML 

I currently have a pdf version of my Resume, so I'll be utilizing GenAI convert it to HTML as well as work on the CSS formatting. I will be performing manual adjustments when needed.

### Prompt to ChatGPT:

Convert this resume format into html.
Please don't use a css framework.
Please use the least amount of css tags

## Utilize Lovable for design ideas

I use Lovable for design ideas. It generated a complete website with a modern look. I only used it as a reference to copy the styling but completely ignored any code generated by the tool. This is the prompt I used" 

```create a website where I display my resume with all my info but also projects. I want you to make a modern desing and also show me the css styling you perform```

This was the output
