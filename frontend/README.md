## Frontend Technical Specification

Create a static website that serves an html resume.

## Resume Format Considerations

I am from Colombia, but I'm currently living in the US, where resumes in word/pdf format are recommended to exclude information. eg. Age, Photo, Relationship. 

I'm going to use the Resume that I have used previously. I try to keep this Resume updated and have worked on it with a few experts on the matter. 

### Converting to HTML 

I currently have a pdf version of my Resume, so I'll be utilizing GenAI convert it to HTML as well as work on the CSS formatting. I will be performing manual adjustments when needed.

### Prompt to ChatGPT:

``Convert this resume format into html.
Please don't use a css framework.
Please use the least amount of css tags``

### Serve Static Website Locally

To serve our static website locally, we need to use stylesheets externally from our HTML page in a Cloud Developer Enviroment (CDE).

This is not necessary with local development. Assuming we have node install we'll use the simple web-server http-server. 

#### Install HTTP Server

npm i http-server -g

![link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

### Server Website

http-server will server a public folder by default where the command is run. In this case, I use npx since we are running it on a Mac and did not want to create the additional folders. 

``cd frontend
npx http-server``

## Utilize Lovable for design ideas

I use Lovable for design ideas. It generated a complete website with a modern look. I only used it as a reference to copy the styling but completely ignored any code generated by the tool. This is the prompt I used" 

```create a website where I display my resume with all my info but also projects. I want you to make a modern desing and also show me the css styling you perform```

This was the output
